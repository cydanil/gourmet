Gourmet Recipe Manager
===================
Try it. It's good!
----------------

Introduction
============

Gourmet Recipe Manager is a manager, editor, and organizer for
recipes. It has a plugin architecture which allows you to enable
extensions to Gourmet's base functionality. For example, there is a
nutritional plugin that allows Gourmet to help you calculate
nutritional information for any recipe. There are also a wide variety
of import and export plugins that let Gourmet read and write recipes
in various formats.

This program aspires to meet the GNOME Human Interface
Guidelines. Please let me know if you see any ways the interface could
become more GNOME HIG compliant (or just improve in general).

Requirements and Installation
=============================

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Development  ![Tests](https://github.com/kirienko/gourmet/workflows/Tests/badge.svg) ![Build](https://github.com/kirienko/gourmet/workflows/Build/badge.svg)
===========
This app has a very long development history. The latest release `0.17.*` is still based on 
`python2` which is no longer supported (since 2020).

This fork is an attempt to make *Gourmet* compatible with `python3`. 
Any help is really appreciated!

Hopefully, one day a new release will be publish in the original repository.
